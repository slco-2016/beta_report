            This version effectively provided two functions: It could send and it could receive text messages. That was it. When onboarding a case manager - we explained that those were the two functions we guaranteed would work. Everything else was either absent or partially developed and obscured from the user. This ultra-streamlined project was the simplest wrapper over the underlying database structure that allowed messages to a single number (attributed to the organization), to be routed to the correct case manager account.

          <h3>
            Learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            Patterns of behaviors towards supervision, differences in peopleâ€™s attitudes, and barriers to complying with supervision that we learned through user research changed the way we understood the problem, and what needed to be built in order to address it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We learned that while some people are indeed simply forgetting their appointments, there are a myriad of social, emotional, financial, logistical, and institutional barriers that account for people failing to comply with their supervision. Some individuals are ambivalent to their complying with the justice system, people may have other things impeding them from avoiding re-arrest and life circumstances can play a role.
          </p>
          <p>
            To better accomplish the goals of our project, we reshaped our development strategy to focus on two way communication that allows case managers to organize and maintain a list of all client contact methods and devices and give clients easier access to information about their supervision that their case manager maintains.
