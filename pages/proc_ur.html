            Overview
          </h3>
          <p>
            The learning phase happens through research focused on understanding of different groups involved, their relationships to the justice system and if and how our software reduces the number of people failing to appear. Interviews, observations and idea generating exercises with people in specific roles within the system to gain a deep understanding of common issues that arise as they work and navigate through it.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Focus Areas
          </h3>
          <p>
            The two main users we are focusing our research on are the primary users who will interface with the tool, Criminal Justice Services (CJS) staff, often case managers, but could also be therapists or mentors. A main objective of our research was to gain insights about how CJS clients view the justice system, barriers they faced in complying with supervision and support systems that they relied on to help them through their supervision. Also important was learning how staff and clients interact with each other and how our software could be best incorporated into their current workflow.
