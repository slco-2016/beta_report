          <h3>
            Shipping as Stakeholder Engagement
          </h3>
          <p>
            During our first month-long intensive in Salt Lake County, our team was able to ship a product once a week. This feedback loop was very powerful and able to command the attention of persons far outside the direct reach or control of our county partners. This is not to diminish the power or capacity of our county partners but rather to illustrate just how high impact shipping can be. It is "real" and when people are able to see their conversations translated into functional, real-world tools in a matter of days, a change occurs. That change is valuable both as a cultural one (the notion that governments can begin to reflect inwardly and question age old practices and be willing to re-evaluate the status quo more broadly) and in terms of just turning heads.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we ship frequently and successfully, we are able to gather buy-in across any pre-existing political boundaries and, if moving fast enough, can often pre-empty existing political road blocks by simply beating other, slower moving governmental factors to "the punch" by executing at an accelerated rate. In this fashion, we can lead by doing and use the advantage to demonstrate how digital tools can be "here to help" and be seen as opportunities rather than threats to the "way things are currently done" in local government (and beyond).
          </p>

            Conclusion
          </h3>
          <p>
            Iterative methods make the software development process part of the research. Features and development are data-driven, meaning use drives development. This leads to lean, well-scoped, and proven software, shipped piecemeal in response to user needs.
