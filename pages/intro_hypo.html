          <h3>
            Initial Hypothesis
          </h3>
          <p>
            People are failing to appear to court appearances and comply with supervision requirements because they forget their appointments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Salt Lake County's intial application, it was posited that the solution to this issue would be that supervision Clients need to be reminded/notified about court appearances so they stay in compliance with supervision, which will reduce the number of people who are arrested and taken to jail.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Revised Hypothesis
          </h3>
          <p>
            Some people are indeed simply forgetting their appointments, but there are other myriad of social, emotional, financial, logistical, and institutional barriers that account for people failing to comply with their supervision.
          </p>

            Academic Research Precedent
          </h3>

            <i>
              "There seems to be little consistent relationship between noncompliance and such factors as social class, age, sex, education, and marital status."

            Facilitation of communication is paramount and adds significant value across the socio-demographic spectrum. Hundreds of research studies have identified client-service communications as critical to client success.
