          <h3>
            Initial Hypothesis
          </h3>
          <p>
            People are failing to appear to court appearances and comply with supervision requirements because they forget their appointments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Salt Lake County's intial application, it was posited that the solution to this issue would be that supervision Clients need to be reminded/notified about court appearances so they stay in compliance with supervision, which will reduce the number of people who are arrested and taken to jail.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Revised Hypothesis
          </h3>
          <p>
            Some people are indeed simply forgetting their appointments, but there are other myriad of social, emotional, financial, logistical, and institutional barriers that account for people failing to comply with their supervision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, it is necessary to consider each case contextually. There is substantial research precedent to affirm that longitudinal communication is paramount and adds significant value across the socio-demographic spectrum. Hundreds of research studies have identified client-service communications as critical to client success.
