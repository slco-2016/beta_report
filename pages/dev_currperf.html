            Analyzing ClientComm's Early Performance: Focus Overview
          </h3>
          <p>
            An effort has been made to analyze ClientComm’s early performance. Because Criminal Justice Services assess organization-wide client and case manager performance on a monthly basis, we are only able to tabulate closed out clients and case manager successes at the beginning of each month. Because the tool has only been in use since mid-March, only the earliest closed out clients from ClientComm can be assessed. Thus, the following analyses will focus solely on those onboarded and closed out of ClientComm within the time frame of mid-March to June 1, 2016. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of clients closed out during this initial period is quite low. While ClientComm has a total client list of roughly 280 clients at present, only 38 were closed out as of the beginning of June. The reason for this is quite simple. Clients in Probation typically spend a substantial number of time - many months - under supervision. As a case managers have typically incorporated ClientComm into the onboarding process for case managers with new clients, the gestation period for close outs will likely exceed the length of our residency. The same situation is present with those in drug court and therapy. Engagements can last significant periods of time. As a result, while a large and ever-growing number of clients are being onboarded to these tools every day, none from these areas are being closed out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the clients being closed out all were from Pretrial. One statistic provided by Criminal Justice Services estimates 90 days as average duration of a client’s tenure in Pretrial services. Essentially, this was the amount of time the client was asked to remain compliant with Pretrial services, up to the court date (that would be assigned at some point during the process). While there are edge cases, this is roughly the process. Again, because ClientComm is so young, we only have a small portion of the clients that were onboarded during Pretrial services closed out. Furthermore, of the clients who are closed out, the population is naturally dispositioned towards unsuccessful pretrial closeouts as successful clients will “last” longer in the CJS system (and, thus, ClientComm).
          </p>

          <h3>
            Analysis of Closed Out Cases
          </h3>
          <p>
            Given the aforementioned caveats, what proceeds is a summary overview of closed clients closed out of ClientComm in the first 2.5 months of use. Of the original 38 clients, only 29 were kept after data cleaning. The primary reasons for exempting clients was that multiple case managers had been sharing an account because they were unaware of how to create new accounts and had been using a single account across multiple employees. When it was explained to them how to create a new account, the extraneous client profiles were closed out. These resulted in some early redundancies. This issue is, ultimately, a casualty of the early development process when features and user experience were not as fully developed. We suspect that, moving forward, such an issue will not be a statistically significant problem to account for. Nonetheless, that means that data cleaning account for a greater-than 22+% reduction in the count of closed-out clients. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the 29 clients, we were able to interview case managers and receive in depth responses on a variety of aspects of 23 clients’ experience through Criminal Justice Services (CJS). Looking specifically at this subset of 23, we found the following statistics:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              30.43% were successfully closed out. This means that these clients complied with the requirements of pretrial and did not fail to appear at their assigned court date. For reference, the client success rate in Pretrial services organization-wide during this period was 66%. Again, ClientComm’s results are predispositioned for failed pretrial terminations during this period because those were the only individuals that would have been closed out in such a short time frame.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 82.61% of the cases, case managers described ClientComm as helpful in achieving and/or maintaining communicating throughout the process, regardless of outcome.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 13.04% of those cases, case managers identified ClientComm as “vital” to the process. That is, without ClientComm, the client would have undoubtedly failed the requirements of pretrial. In cases where the client did ultimately fail but ClientComm was described as critical, ClientComm was described as a valuable lifeline to maintaining contact with non-compliant clients, enabling case managers to keep updated on their situation - regardless of technical compliance - which enabled case managers to communicate vital information, including relevant resources in cases of drug relapses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Of the successfully closed out clients, a full 28.6% of the successes were directly attributed by the case managers to ClientComm. To provide some illustration as to how ClientComm was used in these cases, the following are examples as provided by case managers interviewed:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Client was falling into non-compliance and not responsive to contact via voice calls. ClientComm enabled case manager to bring client back into compliance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Case manager was able to work with client through a series of failed urine analysis and through regular passive check-ins, was able to budge behavior in the ”‘right direction,” such that client was moved out of non-compliance and succeeded in completing pretrial requirements.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            Additional Value-Add Opportunities
          </h3>
          <p>
            In addition to ensuring client success (a symptom of which would include the reduction of the failure-to-appear rate), ClientComm provides a myriad of value add opportunities. Most significantly, ClientComm enables passive communication with clients. Because many clients of Criminal Justice Services lack subscription based cellular contract services, and rather have (often) federally subsidized or personally purchased pay-per-minute devices, voice mail is often an uncertainty. Common issues that plague case managers include voice mail boxes that are not set up or full, or clients who fail to check their voicemail. As a Probation case manager said during an interview, “the phone gets so annoying.” She continued, describing ClientComm as “really helpful; it saves you time, saves you from telephone tag.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Another case manager commented similarly on her frustrations with spending substantial amounts of time engaged in “phone tag.” She added: “[With ClientComm], we’ve been discussing more small things [with our clients]. … I feel like they can just send me a quick update on their lives.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Combined, 51 conversations were held with 29 clients, an average of 1.75 conversations per client. This is slightly below the current average of 2.05 conversations per client that we are observing system-wide as of the start of June. We suspect that this number will rise in the coming weeks as “waves” of newly onboarded clients recently likely skew results toward a lower numerical value than they might indeed be.
          </p>
          <p>
            In discussions with case managers, we were able to assess that achieving success in phone calls can take wildly disparate amounts of time. As discussed prior, phone tag can be an enormous investment of time. Furthermore, after phone calls, case managers must transcribe the contents of the call into C-Tracks, the legacy case management system employed by Criminal Justice Services. By averaging a sample of assessed time investments over a series of interviews, a rough average of 30 minutes was assessed as being the cumulative time spent from engaging in phone tag, leaving messages, logging attempts in C-Tracks, and finally getting ahold of the individual and speaking with them in detail (all followed by more C-Tracks logging). Because all transcription from ClientComm is a simple cut and paste, we can assume greater than 25 minutes are saved for each conversation that can be moved off of the phone and onto ClientComm. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, as case managers attested to in their interview, they are now able to often help two clients at the same time - one view ClientComm while the other is sitting across the desk from them. Thus, there are additional time savings present there as such an effort would simply have not been possible prior with the required phone and verbal exchange. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, we propose a conservative 30 minute estimate of time savings per conversation that is held over ClientComm rather than over the phone. If we accept this assumption, then the 377 closed messages as of the first week of June amount to 188.5 hours of case manager time has been “saved.” Specifically, this is time case managers can spend being more effective and servicing clients directly, rather than be embroiled in simply getting in contact with a single client. If we assume a dollar value of time at $25.00 per hour, we can estimate over $4,700.00 in case manager time saved (or, perhaps, better allocated) thus far. With 187 additional currently open conversations, it is fair to assume that another roughly $2,300.00 in savings is also “underway” for a total of over $7,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we conservatively assume a constant rate of use (even though more case managers have been onboarded recently, thus indicating that use will increase at a more than constant rate due to a larger installed user base), ClientComm could potentially deliver $21,000.00 in case manager time savings by the end of this calendar year.
          </p>
