            What is ClientComm?
          </h3>
          <p>
            ClientComm allows case managers to communicate their clients easily through text messaging. We are on Version 3 of the tool, with updates and features based upon what we learn about user's needs and feedback solicited through a chat feature embedded on each page.
          </p>

          <h3>
            How does ClientComm work?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Case Manager's can add to list of their clients and can add multiple contact methods for each client. This allows them to keep track of the clients on their caseload and have readily available all the ways they can reach out to each client.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case managers can send a text to one clients number, see if it went through, and if not, they can quickly send messages to any numbers they have on file for that client to try and reach out to them. This solves several issues we found with the current system. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients switch phones for a myriad of reasons - if one device gets shut off, stolen, lost or run out of battery. Some borrow or share phones, and others have phones that only work when they have access to a wifi signal. This can make it hard for case managers to connect with their clients. Case managers can spend 30 minutes trying to reach out to client through various numbers. n a private record of conversations with each client. 
          </p>

            Monitoring ClientComm
          </h3>
          <p>
            Application usage is measured by the number messages sent, open conversations, and volume of daily messaging activity, segmented by week, day and time of day.
