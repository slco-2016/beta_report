            <span class="blue">
              Salt Lake County came to Code for America for help with individuals not showing up for court appearances and other appointments, which are required for them to stay in compliance with the justice system. This decreases the efficiency of the court system, increasing costs and causing delays.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            For the individuals going through the justice system, this is a problem because missing a court appointments results in a bench warrant being issued. The next time that individual comes in contact with police, even for a minor violation like a traffic ticket, they are arrested on the spot and taken to jail. This interruption has the potential to damage peopleâ€™s lives. During our research, we heard from people who were on their way to work when they were arrested and others who were with their kids at the time.
