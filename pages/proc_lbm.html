          <h3>
            Breaking down the Philosophy
          </h3>
          <p>
            Learn: observe what works and what needs to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Build: make small things to meet the needs of clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Measure: collect data on how people use what you made and its impact on the system. This helps us know if what we are building is what people want. Furthermore, we need to understand how it can best fit into their workflow and address real pain point. 
          </p>

          <h3>
            Cycles in the Fellowship
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is not a single event. Cycles operate in tight iteration cycles. An entire cycle can occur in a short time frame. With ClientComm, many delivery cycles have been as short as 2 weeks. Keeping tight cycles allows for speed and flexibilty. Furthermore, it forces us as the developers to remain detached from our work, will to dump efforts rather error through sunk cost fallacies of logic.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Wait, isn't is "Build, Measure, Learn?"
          </h3>
          <p>
            Nope! We meant "Learn, Build, Measure." Actually, it might be more like: "Learn > Build > Measure > Learn > Build > Measure > Learn > Build > Measure > Learn > Build > Measure > Learn ..."
          </p>
          <p>
            A "first pass" of observation of case managers and clients in their meetings, in-depth interviews with individuals, and participatory activities like card sorts and system mapping enabled us to familiarze ourselves through immersion in the common issues and different perspectives on the problem we are tackling by those who deal with them daily - the clients, case managers, and supervisors.
