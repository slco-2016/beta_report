            Proposed Calculations

          <p>
            Similar to how we have attempted to begin to measure time savings and time efficiency allocations via ClientComm's conversations count, 
            <span class="blue">
              we would like to begin using longitudinal assessments of client compliance and ClientComm use
            </span>
            to measure metrics related to the client process through Criminal Justice Services. From maintained urine analysis compliance to availment of drug rehabilitation services in cases of technical non-compliance, there are number of situations where clients can be directed in such a manner as to both best help them as well as optimize use of the criminal justice system in Salt Lake County. Through such service redirects, clients can also stay out of jail (a cost of $95.00 per day), wasted court dates, and costly arrest and booking processes. With some additional research, our team aims to specify what these dollar amounts are and then begin multiplying the measures successes for each client against these value to illustrate further system efficiencies achieved.
