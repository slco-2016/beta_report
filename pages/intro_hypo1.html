            Revising the Hypothesis
          </h3>
          
          <p><i>
            "Every client comes a different kind of need. You treat each one is a separate way ... some that need more encouragement some that need more guidance."

          <p>
            Supervision Clients are juggling a lot - like finding and keeping a job, staying sober, taking care of their kids, and keeping a roof over their heads. Maintaining consistent, open communication with their case managers is key to navigating all of this while completing supervision successfully. 
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            More than Forgetting
          </h3>

          <p><i>
            "Clients that don't have a lot of arrests prior to me seeing them and one that have a good support system are the ones more likely to be successful."
          </i>
            <br>
            <span class="blue" style="float:right">
              - Criminal Justice Services Case Manager

            <br>
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            We learned that some people are indeed simply forgetting their appointments, but there are other social, emotional, financial, logistical, and institutional barriers that account for people failing to appear at court and comply with their supervision. We revised our hypothesis taking into consideration what we learned from people struggling with supervision appointments and how they thought about this problem.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Current Working Hypothesis
          </h3>

          <p><i>
            "[Texting] would be good for my clients who are homeless or are financially strapped and only use phones for texting."
          </i>
            <br>
            <span class="blue" style="float:right">
              - Criminal Justice Services Case Manager
            </span>
            <br>
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            Because clients can be overwhelmed and uncertain of all the requirements of the judicial system, case managers need to be able to better communicate with clients to help remove obstacles such that clients can complete supervision successfully.
          </p>
