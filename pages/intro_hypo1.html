            Initial Learnings
          </h3>
          <p>
            From our research we learned  that while some people are indeed simply forgetting their appointments, there are other social, emotional, financial, logistical, and institutional barriers that account for people failing to appear at court and complying with their supervision.

            Revising the Problem Statement
          </h3>

          <p>
            Supervision Clients are juggling a lot - like finding and keeping a job, staying sober, taking care of their kids, and keeping a roof over their heads. Maintaining consistent, open communication with their case managers is key to navigating all of this while completing supervision successfully.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Current Problem Statement
          </h3>

          <p>
            We revised our problem statement taking into consideration what we learned from people struggling with supervision appointments and how they thought about this problem: 
            <span class="blue">Supervision Clients in Salt Lake County and their case managers need to communicate more easily so clients understand everything they need to do and case managers can help remove obstacles to can complete supervision successfully</span>.
