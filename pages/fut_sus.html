          <p>
            As ClientComm has become a central tool to the workflow of a number of case managers, a discussion of sustainability has become ever more pressing. We have met with the Mayor twice already and have a third meeting scheduled for the end of June. At this meeting, we will be presenting to both him and the Criminal Justice Advisory Council on our work. This high level of leadership buy-in will, if executed successfully, go far in ensuring that momentum is sustained and that proper resources will be made available. 
            <span class="blue">The mayor has personally identified that he sees value in this tool for other case management situations</span>, such as the Department of Family Services and homeless outreach services.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to securing leadership buy in, <span class="blue">we have heavily documented our process</span>. Our weekly reports are all uploaded online and publicly available (see below link). Also, our process has been documented through a series (read: hundreds) of mixed media posts. These are collected online, on our blog. Finally, all our code has been housed in a single, completely open source Github organization. (Github is a website that holds code for software projects, often open source as in the case of our work.) Sustained projects at end of year will also be forked over into Code For America's primary Github organization.
          </p>
